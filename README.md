# SeqCode Registry Workshop

The Code for Nomenclature of Prokaryotes Described from Sequence Data (SeqCode).

## Description  

The **SeqCode Registry** is a web-based portal for the **registration, tracking, curation, and validation** of prokaryotic names using **genome sequence data** as a basis for classification. It integrates **automated quality checks** and **nomenclatural validation and genomic reviews**. Additionally, it features a **multi-scheme taxonomic browser**, allowing researchers to explore and compare different classification systems.  

In this workshop, we will use a **metagenomic approach** to characterize **microbial diversity** based on **Metagenome-Assembled Genomes (MAGs)**. **High-quality MAGs** that meet the required criteria can be formally described as **novel species** following the **SeqCode** guidelines. The workshop will guide you through the **registration process, quality assessment, and validation of new species names**.

## Objectives  

By the end of this session, you will learn:  
 âœ… **How to register** a new prokaryotic name in the SeqCode Registry  
 âœ… **Required information** for name registration  
 âœ… **Assessing quality and statistics** of MAGs, including public availability criteria  
 âœ… **Filling the etymology table**: Guidelines for proper nomenclature  
 âœ… **Automated quality checks** for genomic data  
 âœ… **Curation process**: Reviewing and validating submitted data  
 âœ… **Validation of published names** under SeqCode  
 âœ… **Certificates of Validation**: Understanding their role and significance

## Accessing the SeqCode Registry  

The **SeqCode Registry** can be accessed at:  
ðŸ”— [SeqCode Registry](https://seqco.de/)  

The registry is part of **The SeqCode Initiative**, which promotes the classification of prokaryotic species based on **genomic data**:

## Workshop Activities  

During this workshop, we will **navigate through the SeqCode platform**, explore **the registration process**, and discuss **best practices for submitting new species names based on high-quality MAGs**. 

ðŸ›  **Hands-on Activities:**  
1. **Exploring the SeqCode Registry Interface**  
   - How to find existing taxa  
   - Searching for previously registered names  
   - Navigating the taxonomy browser  

2. **Registering a New Species Name**  
   - Creating an account and logging in  
   - Filling the required information    

3. **Quality Control Checks**  
   - Etymology
   - Understanding automated checks  

4. **Curation and Validation**  
   - The review process  
   - Publishing and validating names
